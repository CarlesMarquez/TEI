This publication constitutes the fifth distinct version of the \textit{Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}, and the first complete revision since the appearance of P3 in 1994. It includes substantial amounts of new material and a major revision of the underlying technical infrastructure. With this version, these Guidelines enter a new stage in their development as a community-maintained open source project. This edition is the first version to have benefitted from the close overview and oversight of an elected TEI Technical Council. The editors are therefore particularly pleased to acknowledge with gratitude the hard work and dedication put into this project by the Council over the last five years.\par
The Chair of the TEI Board sits on the Technical Council, and the Board appoints the Chair of the Technical Council and one other member of the Council. Other Council members are all elected by the Consortium membership, and serve periods of up to two years at a time. The names and affiliations of all Council members who served during the production of this edition of the Guidelines are listed below. \leftline{\textbf{Board Chair}} \begin{itemize}

From 2000 to 2008 the TEI had two appointed Editors, Lou Burnard (University of Oxford) and Syd Bauman (Brown University), who served \textit{ex officio} on the Council and, as far as possible, on all Council workgroups.\par
The Council also oversees an Internationalization and Localization project, led by Sebastian Rahtz and with funding from the ALLC. This activity, ongoing since October 2005, is engaged in translating key parts of the P5 source into a variety of languages.\par
Production of the translations currently included in P5 has been coordinated by the following: \begin{description}

\item[{Chinese}]Marcus Bingenheimer (Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies, Taipei / Temple University) and Weining Hwang (Würzburg University)
\item[{French}]Pierre-Yves Duchemin (ENSSIB); Jean-Luc Benoit (ATILF); Anila Angjeli (BnF); Joëlle Bellec Martini (BnF); Marie-France Claerebout (Aldine); Magali Le Coënt (BIUSJ); Florence Clavaud (EnC); Cécile Pierre (BIUSJ).

Any one who works closely with the TEI Guidelines, whether as translator, editor, or reader is constantly reminded of the ambitious scope and exceptionally high editorial standards set by the original project, now approaching twenty years ago. It is appropriate therefore to retain a sense of the history of this document, as it has evolved since its first appearance in 1990, and to acknowledge with gratitude the contributions made to that evolution by very many individuals and institutions around the world. The original prefatory notes to each major edition of the Guidelines recording these names are therefore preserved in an appendix to the current edition (see \textit{\hyperref[PREFS]{Appendix H\ Prefatory Notes}}).
